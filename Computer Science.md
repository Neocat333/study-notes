## Science Terminology

### Statement

> A group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a
statement."

Example:

```
nyan = pasu * 2;
```

Reference: [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md).

### Expression

> An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.

Expressions are most often combined to make [statements](#statement) that perform certain tasks.

Some examples of expressions include, but not limited to, literal value expression (`42`); literal string expression (`"nyanpasu"`); arithmetic expression (`n * 42`); variable expression (`nya`); and assignment expression (`nya = n * 42`). It is worth noting that a function call (`console.log()`) is also an expression.

Reference: [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md).

### Operators

Operators are used to perform actions on values and variables.

### Primitive Data Type

A data type that cannot be decomposed to smaller components.

### Scope

The result of a process in which, for a given location in some code, a set of rules for storing and retrieving variables is determined. See also [this figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/master/scope%20%26%20closures/fig2.png) in YDKJS.

### Static Typing

A language implementation that requires variables declared under this scheme to hold a specific type of value.

### Weak/Dynamic Typing

A language implementation that allows variables declared under this scheme to hold values of any type.
