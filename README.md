## Introduction

This repository contain notes that I made while going through computer science and web development materials. While the content of these notes are meant to be as accurate as possible, I take no responsibilities for losses caused by the use of incorrect information in this repository (I would still feel bad about it though), for more information about usage please see the license enclosed.

Sentences derived from studying material are presented as block quotes or marked with quotation marks. The source of information, where applicable, is included with ever entry.

## Progress

I started keeping track of my study progress after bumping into [P1xt's SpeedStudy](https://github.com/P1xt/speedstudy) idea. The details can be found [here](https://github.com/honmanyau/study-notes/blob/master/Progress.md).
