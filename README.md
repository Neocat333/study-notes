## Introduction

This repository contain notes that I made while going through computer science and web development materials. While the content of these notes are meant to be as accurate as possible (accurate !== elaborate), I take no responsibilities for any loss caused by the use of incorrect information in this repository (I would still feel bad about it though), for more information about usage please see the license enclosed.

Sentences derived from studying material are presented as block quotes or marked with quotation marks; references are included wherever applicable.

## A Note on the Notes

The notes and questions are meant for myself and they are therefore not self-contained and, at times, they are the minimum possible that I require to recall deeper concepts. If you do end up using the notes because you find them somewhat useful but are "insufficient" for your needs, you may find the references provided useful.

The questions are meant for myself and are written to cater to my own taste. A good portion of them are open-ended questions that, I personally think, are fun. A few questions (only very few) purely meant for fun to the point that they were written with devious intentions... so, don't use them on yourself or anyone else for anything other than fun (no, making fun of someone isn't fun).

## Progress

I started keeping track of my study progress after bumping into [P1xt's SpeedStudy](https://github.com/P1xt/speedstudy) idea. The details can be found [here](https://github.com/honmanyau/study-notes/blob/master/Progress.md).

Please feel free to submit issues regarding typos, missing references, incorrect content and incomplete content (incomplete means where my thoughts obviously drifted away and forgot to write the rest of a sentence or paragraph).
