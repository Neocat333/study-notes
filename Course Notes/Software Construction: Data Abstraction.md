## Notes

### 1. Introduction to Software Construction

#### First Look

* Look and files and folders
* Run the program
* Relate the app to the code
* Inter-package relationship
* Inter-file relationship

### 2a. Control and Data Flow: Structures

#### Call Graphs

A graph showing what methods is called by other methods.

#### Classes and Objects

* Class is a way of encapsulating information
* A class contains the characteristics of the data it represents
* A class contains operations which can be performed on the data it represents (methods)

#### Anatomy of a Class

* `final`: immutable
* `static`: stays within a class and not instantiated with an object

**Style conventions**

1. Important statements
2. Class declaration
3. Constants and fields
4. Constructors
5. Public and private methods

### 2b: Control and Data Flow: Models

#### Data Flow

How information is passed around in a program.

#### Debugging, Part 3

> What is the main reason to avoid magic numbers?

> Because we don't do magic, we do computer science

Gold!

#### Quiz

> if the condition at A was changed to (!(condition at A)) then how would the flowchart for the method change: (Assume only labels are used for the flowchart)

That last bit about "Assume only labels are used for the flowchart" is misleading. D: The chart would reverse if we were not using labels, but if the label `A` is used to abstract away all the detail, as suggested by the provided assumption, then it does not matter if the conditions inside A is now the reverse of what it was beforeâ€”because `A` will always evaluate to either `true` or `false` and the branches in the flow chart does not reverse...
