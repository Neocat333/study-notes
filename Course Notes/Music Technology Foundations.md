## Notes

### 1: Introduction to sound

#### What is music technology?

* Music technology is not limited to computers and electronics—using tools to make sound for music purposes is music technology.
* The ability and ease to record music nowadays has democratised access to, and the production of, music.

#### Theremin demonstration

* Leon Theremin
* Theremin produces sound via heterodyning.

Uwah, Clara Rockmore is amazing [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLEiTaey66qmD17v-oJ7aOTbfgADGd_Rgc&v=pSzTPGlNa5U).

#### Sound recording

Distortion—sound too loud for the recording device and distorts. Try different angles and/or pulling the receiver/microphone further away from the sound source.

#### Music revolutionaries: Leon Scott, Charles Cros & Thomas Edison

* Leon Scott
