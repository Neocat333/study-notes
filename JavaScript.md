> The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.

Source: [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md).

#### What are the differences between var, let, and const?

`// Placeholder`

#### Implicit in JavaScript coercion is evil.

No, not necessarily; and that statement suggests a lack of understanding of the rules behind implicit coercion.
