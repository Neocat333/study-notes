## Terminology

### CSS Reset

A CSS reset removes or normalises the CSS predefined CSS rules implemented by different browsers so that a designer/web developer can start from a common baseline for a unified experience across the targeted browsers (provided that any additional CSS rules added after resetting are compatible with the targeted browsers).

### Key Selector

The selector immediately before an opening curly bracket, which "identifies exactly which element the styles will be applied to."

### Prequalifier

Selector(s) that appear before (to the left) of the [key selector](#key-selector).

### Specificity

The relative importance of a CSS declaration that is determined by its selector or combination of selectors. The specificity of a selector is represented as a three-value point system; with the lowest level specificity represented as `0-0-1` (for example, a type selector), the medium level of specificity represented as `0-1-0` (for example, a class selector), and the highest level of specificity represented as `1-0-0` (for example, an id selector). Specificity is additive.

### Selector

> ... designates exactly which element or elements within our HTML to target and apply styles (such as color, size, and position) to.
